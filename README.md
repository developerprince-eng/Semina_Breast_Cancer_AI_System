# Semina Breast Classifer

This is a Project from Semina which seeks to create AIS (Artificical Intelligent Systems) which enables pathologist and medical experts to be able to classify a woman to be etheir be Benign or Malignant when it comes to being Diagnosed for Breast Cancer Either by FNA Biopsy (Fine Needle Aspiration) or Mammography. The DataSets for this project comes makes use of Data from Wincosin which is FNA  based Data of cells, DDSM and MIAS which are Dataset obtained from Mammography which in retrospect are mammograms on is in form of serialized tfrecords and the later in bpm (bitmap) Images.

The project is highly experiment this is a guide to Semina clinically implemement the AIS after overcoming the obstacles meet in classification and also coming up with a standard way of obtaining either standardised Images from MRI and also having standard input parameters for FNA Biopsy.

The project is being developed by DeveloperPrince being guided by Advisory Pathologist who's names shall not be exposed in this documentation.

## Configuration

    The project assumes that you have experience with Python and Basics in ML & NN(Machine Learning and Nueral Networks). It assumes you have basic or an appreciation into statical mathematical computation and Data Science and Mathematics. You should have knowledge in Cancer and its behaviour. 

    NB: Make sure you switch to virtual environment to set the project

    The configurations and setup shall be listed below:
